# Building your own images

You can build images from scratch, or based on existing ones with your own modifications and additional software. And you can do this manually or with a Dockerfile. Let's explore both ways of doing it.

Before digging into the lab please set the following variables to your own values (your docker ID and the name of the app you want to use), so that later on you can easily refer to them:

```
export your_docker_id=<your docker ID>
export your_app_name=<your app name>
```

## Option 1: Manually

You can run an Ubuntu container in interactive mode, and add an application (*myapp.sh*) inside it.

```
docker run -it --name testapp ubuntu /bin/bash
    echo -e "#! /bin/bash\necho It works!" > myapp.sh
    chmod +x myapp.sh
    exit
```

When you exit the container it goes to *exited*, so it is stopped and can be seen with the `dockers ps -a` command.

You may now save these new R/W container layers as R/O ones, creating a new image, with `docker commit testapp $your_docker_id/$your_app_name`.

![Docker image manually](/posts/files/docker-201/assets/images/docker_manual.png)

Now delete the *exited* container with `docker rm testapp`.

And run the app that you created inside the container:

```
docker run --name testapp $your_docker_id/$your_app_name /myapp.sh
```

![Docker manual run](/posts/files/docker-201/assets/images/docker_manual_run.png)

As you may have noticed you had to specify the path and application name you wanted to execute when running the container. Let's make it easier by setting the execution of *myapp.sh* as default when running that image.

```
docker commit --change='CMD [“/myapp.sh”]' testapp $your_docker_id/$your_app_name
```

Now that our image is ready let's run it in a container without the parameters we used before: `docker --rm $your_docker_id/$your_app_name`. The `--rm` parameter automatically deletes the container when it exits, so that we do not have to delete it manually afterwards.

## Option 2: With a Dockerfile

As with any manual method you may have already guessed it does not scale very well. So we can automate image creation with a special file called *Dockerfile*.

Let's first create another *myapp.sh* in your local host, with the following content:

```
#! /bin/bash
echo "I am a cow!" | /usr/games/cowsay | /usr/games/lolcat -f
```

Assign permissions to execute it with `chmod +x myapp.sh`.

Now you need to create a file called *Dockerfile* in your local host, with the following content:

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y cowsay lolcat && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY myapp.sh /myapp/myapp.sh
CMD ["/myapp/myapp.sh"]
```

Each line of this Dockerfile creates a new R/W layer in our new image. As per the file our image is based on a standard Ubuntu, then it installs some software required for *myapp.sh*, then copies our *myapp.sh* from the host to the container, and finally sets the default command when running a container with this image to call that *myapp.sh* application.

Now you can build your new image for this app, and run a new container for it, with:

```
docker build -t $your_docker_id/$your_app_name .
docker run --rm $your_docker_id/$your_app_name
```

![Dockerfile](/posts/files/docker-201/assets/images/dockerfile1.png)
![Dockerfile](/posts/files/docker-201/assets/images/dockerfile2.png)

You can now see the R/O layers created for each command in the Dockerfile:

```
docker history $your_docker_id/$your_app_name | head -n 4
```

## Dockerhub

One of the great benefits of containers is that they can be distributed via registries, where containers are conveniently stored for download. These registries host public and private repositories, depending on user needs.

You may create a user for free at [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com), the default container registry for Docker, so you can upload your own images to your own repositories.

Once registered please login from your host with `docker login`. That way you will be able to *push* your image to Dockerhub. At that point you can delete your local image and run a container that pulls the remote image from Dockerhub.

```
docker push $your_docker_id/$your_app_name
docker rmi $your_docker_id/$your_app_name
docker run --rm $your_docker_id/$your_app_name
```

(note: for this last section I have used my own computer instead of the public play_with_docker site, because you need to login to Dockerhub before pushing your image, and you would rather not provide your credentials in a public environment).

#### Congratulations! You know now how to customize and build your own images, both manually and with a Dockerfile. You have also learned how to publish them to Dockerhub. Let's explore now how networking and storage works for containers!
