Microservices Overview

# Objective

This Learning Lab should give you a basic understanding of microservices, containers, and cloud native applications.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# Prerequisites

* Understanding the distinction between VM's and containers 
* Experience in app development

# Audience

* DevOps engineers
* Application developers

# Considerations of Cloud Native applications

With the significant adoption of public and private cloud technologies, largely driven by developer adoption, the infrastructure and shape of a "cloud native" application is emerging. From an infrastructure standpoint, developers can expect:

* The ability to access, compute and store in an on-demand manner
* To be able to deploy continuously to production
* To use feature flags to enable and disable application functionality
* To have the ability to measure many aspects of the application and user behavior

In the shape of an application, developers should follow the guidelines of the "12 Factor App".  This set of factors are very important for delivering a cloud native application, and considered the "gold standard" for Cloud Native application design.

* [12 Factor app](http://12factor.net)
I. Codebase: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. Config: Store config in the environment
IV. Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources
V. Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. Processes execute the app as one or more stateless processes
VII. Port binding: Export services via port binding
VIII. Concurrency: Scale out via the process model
IX. Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. Logs: Treat logs as event streams
XII. Admin processes: Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
