# Benefits

To understand why we would want to use containers, let's look at how we deploy applications without them, contrasting that workflow with the benefits of virtualization. Then we can see how containers offer benefits that neither of these preceding solutions offer.

## Bare metal or single host
Organizations used to deploy multiple applications onto the same server, using package managers like DEB, RPM or YUM, sometimes via an automation tool such as Puppet or Chef. This filled the server directory structure with the components of many applications.

### Bare metal/single host deployment downsides

* Quickly gets messy
* Relies on OPS team to validate changes. "Don't touch the server."
* Can create conflicts between application dependencies.
* Hard to isolate issues.
* Hard to scale or migrate applications.
* Inter-app communication hard to debug.

## Virtual Machines
Next organizations used virtualization to isolate each application in its own VM, improving order and repeatability. Often, each VM duplicated the same deployment tooling (manual packages or Puppet/Chef, etc.) as in the bare metal scenario.

Some engineering teams realized the value of "baking" a golden VM image for each release of each application, so that new VMs could be swapped out for old ones in a near-stateless fashion, with no commands (RPM, installations, Puppet, etc.) needed. This allowed Continuous Delivery/Integration systems to produce artifacts (the VM image) that could be easily deployed to production.

However, with VMs being full operating systems, each image still takes up considerable resources and takes a while to boot and start services, and still didn't provide on-demand scaling or immediate healing.

## Containers

Imagine the pre-baked image benefits of VMs, coupled with near-immediate bootup time and reduced complexity. We don't need a whole OS in each image anymore, because containers run *on top* of a single operating system, so our baked application image is now only as big as our application and its dependencies. Easier to store, share, and deploy.

## Toolchain advantage

The rise of containers complements and *enables* a growing change in software development methodologies such as DevOPS, designed to remove roadblocks from the development process, get the developers involved in the packaging and production of their own code... and get things into production quicker.

Notice, however, that the diagrams above were not just about isolation:

* We talked about Packaging/Baking software images.
	- How is that done?

* We talked about not using RPM/DEB to deploy software.
	- So how do the images get onto the system?

* We didn't even touch on how someone actually says "Start application XYZ"
	- How does this happen?

Earlier, we said that tools and features created *around* the actual container technology bring the value to "containers"... these developer toolchains are the exact things that address all of the questions above.

When most people talk about "containers", they are talking about this whole toolchain.

Consider that this illustration shows a process that developers can use for building, packaging, versioning and deploying their apps.

## Summary

Containers change how we package and deploy code, files, binaries, and libraries onto systems. Proper leveraging of containerization allows your entire organization to improve application quality, isolation, robustness, and timeliness.

And THIS is why containers matter. They provide a whole toolchain that a developer can use to go from code to packaged, repeatable container deployments of an app.

Docker is one such toolchain for achieving this, and it is by far the most popular one, at present. Explore the **Docker 101** lab to put this deep container knowledge to work, gaining hands-on skills with everything we've just discussed.
