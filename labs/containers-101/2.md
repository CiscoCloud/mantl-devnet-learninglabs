# Containers: Benefits

To understand why we would want to use containers in the first place, let's first look at how we would deploy applications without them. Then, we can contrast that workflow with the benefits of virtualization. Subsequently, we will be able to see how containers offer benefits that neither of these preceding solutions offer.

## Bare Metal or Single Host
Applications teams used to deploy all applications onto the same server, using simple operating system packaging such as DEB or RPM, and perhaps using a layer of automation such as Puppet or Chef. This server's directory structure was filled with the components of many applications.

* Oldest and simplest method of deploying applications; gets messy quickly
* Usually relies on OPS team to ‘validate’ changes. "Don't touch the server."
* Conflicts between application dependencies can occur.
* Hard to isolate issues.
* Hard to scale or migrate applications.
* Inter-app communication hard to debug.

## Virtual Machines
Operations teams then used virtualization to gain isolation, giving each application its own VM in order to create order and repeatability. Often, each VM duplicated the same deployment tooling (manual packages or puppet/chef, etc.) as in the bare metal scenario.

Some engineering teams realized the value of "baking" a golden VM image for each release of each application, so that new VMs could be swapped out for old ones in a near-stateless fashion, with no commands (RPM, installations, puppet, etc.) needed. This allowed CI/CD systems to produce artifacts (the VM image) that could be deployed to production easily.

With each VM providing a full operating system, however, each image still takes a while to boot and start services, so this approach still didn't provide on-demand scaling or the immediate that healing some operations teams wanted.

A lot of teams continued to manage VMs manually (or near-manually), using VM's purely for the isolation that they provided.

## Containers

Imagine the pre-baked image benefits of VM's, coupled with near-immediate bootup time and a lot less complexity. We don't need a whole OS in each of our images anymore, because containers run *on top* of a *single* operating system (all that cGroups stuff... remember?) Therefore, our baked application image is now only as big as our application and its dependencies, making it easier to store, share, and deploy.

## In Summary...

Containers change how we package and deploy code, files, binaries, and libraries onto systems.

The rise of containers complements and *enables* a growing change in software development methodologies such as DevOPS, designed to remove roadblocks from the development process, get the developers involved in the packaging and production of their own code... and get things into production quicker.

Notice, however, that the diagrams above were not just about isolation:

* We talked about Packaging / Baking software images.
	- How is that done?

* We talked about not using RPM/DEB to deploy software.
	- So how do the images get onto the system?

* We didn't even touch on how someone actually says "Start application XYZ"
	- How does this happen?

Earlier, we said that tools and features created *around* the actual container technology bring the value to "containers"... these developer toolchains are the exact things that address all of the questions above.

When most people talk about "containers", they are talking about this whole toolchain.

Consider that this illustration shows a process that developers can use for building, packaging, versioning and deploying their apps. The actual Cgroup technology is that tiny highlighed red box, but containers have become synonymous with the following idea:

>**Containers change how developers package and deploy their apps... for the better.**

And THIS is why containers matter. They provide a whole toolchain that a developer can use to go from code to packaged, repeatable container deployments of an app.

Docker is one such toolchain for achieving this, and it is by far the most popular one, at present. Explore the **Docker 101** lab to put this deep container knowledge to work, gaining hands-on skills with everything we've just discussed.
