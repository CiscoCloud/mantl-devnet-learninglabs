# 9. Testing our OwnCloud Service

## What just happened?
If you're familiar with Kubernetes, you'll have noticed the multiple kubernetes resources in the configuration we just uploaded,

- A `service` to provide a Virtual IP and load balancing into our app.
- A `deployment` of the actual containerised applications we need to run.
- A `configmap` of our configuration options, so we don't need to bake a new container image just to tweak options.

Last but by no means least, a `PersistentVolumeClaim`, a production deployment would have multiple for different functions, but we compressed this for the same of the lab. `PersistentVolumeClaims` dynamically provision blocks of persistent storage from HyperFlex to use within kubernetes applications, allowing kubernetes to host items such as databases and in our case, a file storage application.

You can monitor the progress of your deployment in the UI, click PersistentVolumeClaims at the bottom of the left hand kubernetes menu. You will see a volume now "bound" to your application.

If you still have VCenter open, you will have seen the Kubernetes cluster dynamically mount the volume through to your Cisco Container Platform VM's so that the Kubernetes cluster can consume the persistent storage.

# Summary
Cisco Container Platform gives you and your development teams the portability and agility of known-good kubernetes deployments, with a cloud-like provisioning and consumption API on a fully-supported on-premise stack, starting from just three servers.

With the rise of IOT and Smart-industry enabled applications demanding hybrid or local low-latency edge compute, Cisco Container Platform is the perfect way to deploy to the edge without adding unnecessary expense or complexity to your development teams' roadmap.

We hope you found this lab informative!
