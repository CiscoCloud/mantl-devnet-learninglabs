# 5. Testing our OwnCloud Service

## What just happened?
If you're familiar with Kubernetes, you'll have noticed the multiple kubernetes resources in the configuration we just uploaded,

- A `service` to provide a Virtual IP and load balancing into our app.
- A `deployment` of the actual containerised applications we need to run.
- A `configmap` of our configuration options, so we don't need to bake a new container image just to tweak options.

Last but by no means least, multiple `PersistentVolumeClaims`, these dynamically provision blocks of persistent storage from HyperFlex to use within kubernetes applications, allowing kubernetes to host items such as databases and in our case, a file storage application.

You can monitor the progress of your deployment in the UI, click PersistentVolumeClaims at the bottom of the left hand kubernetes menu. You will see numerous volumes now "bound" to your application.

If you still have VCenter open, you will have seen the Kubernetes cluster dynamically mount the volumes through to your Cisco Container Platform VM's so that the Kubernetes cluster can consume the persistent storage.
