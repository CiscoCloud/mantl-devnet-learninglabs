Cisco Container Platform 101

# 2. Provider Settings and VIP Pools

Clicking around the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you'll notice a menu to the left.
Here, an admin can configure users and groups (including Active Directory login authentication, allowing access to clusters based on the users AD group.) and define also define VIP pools.

VIP pools allow an administrator to define a "real" IP range that clusters can use to integrate with the existing IT or Enterprise environment, each cluster is assigned a VIP pool, and Cisco Container Platform will manage allocations of addresses from that pool to each Kubernetes cluster when an "externally" reachable IP is needed, such as exposing kubernetes services.

Notice in the Cluster details page, a VIP has already been assigned to the Master node of your cluster, allowing access to the Kubernetes dashboard in your sandbox. The POD IP addresses used within the cluster are all internal and do not interact with any external networks; these have been configured on 192.168.0.0/16 for your cluster.

# 3. Cisco Container Platform API's
Each Cisco Container platform installation comes with integrated API documentation, powered by Swagger.
You can access this [HERE (https://10.10.20.30:32238/2/swaggerapi/)](https://10.10.20.30:32238/2/swaggerapi/), where you will see all the currently supported platform API's.

Click on "List Operations" to expand the subsections, in this Lab, we're going to use the `/2/system` and `/2/clusters` sections, so expand those;

## Authenticate to the API
The swagger UI will remember our authentication token once we use the `/2/system/login` API call, so that all other API's on the swagger page will work.
Use your Cisco Container Platform credentials `admin/Cisco123`, expand the `/2/system/login` box and enter the username and password, then hit `Try it Out!`.

You should see a response code of 200, if not, check your credentials and try again!

## Query your clusters
We can use the API to query Cisco Container Platform for available clusters, only Clusters you have permission to see will be returned!

Expand the blue "GET" API labelled `/2/clusters` and hit `Try it out!`. Because we are querying for all clusters this API call needs no parameters.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/swagger_list_all_clusters.png)

The information we get back is used by the Cisco Cloud Platform UI to show information about our cluster, such as the number of workers and master nodes, as well as the state of the cluster.

We also are given the Cluster's UUID, this can be used for performing API actions against a specific cluster.

#4 Creating a new Cluster.
Actually, lets create two.

Firstly, from the UI, on the clusters tab, click "New Cluster"

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/newclusterbutton.png)

You will be prompted to answer questions about your new cluster, from number of worker nodes, to where in the Hyperflex VM infrastructure it should be placed.

For our sandbox, there are only one set of options for most, selection boxes. Fill in as follows...

For SSH Public Key, you can use your own SSH pubic key or paste in the key below:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDIyJZfCNzDNJ+RupHpY8HhpvEq4YCz58FZONMxZCXY0RZB0uSTqu2fJ4KNDdOGggKPxaVkHam6GZoI8bBbclnViuI3yuo3rmeJoOlInGKXjAJ2KfnHHAXvmPj2UE4ritvdEOK+fJ0dGLKXCDFrolLKc8n4S1ck7cVmv1ruJ3+4iHJXhlp2Ea4irvIuwndgnZeKs4Zem5BZJh2trk6Cq7ctS1MgrjNy8fpFYIttjHuvWPSZ772IBI4jcjioEKJZYnayG9eVBBVuiLWHTuF8ZcaKvySlgrif0PG2Dj7zTsgOZtnJXhD36h2wOXJdUqsy1V7oHVPW1S16wantBN534QMz sandbox@CCP_SANDBOX_KEY
```

Click `NEXT`

Click `NEXT`

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/new-cluster-ui-3.png)

Ensure on the 'Node Configuration' screen you have set `Worker Nodes` to `1`. The sandbox environment has limited resources to enable quality of service for other sandbox users and we want the cluster creation to succeed!

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/one-worker-vm.png)

Click `NEXT`

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/new-cluster-ui-4.png)

Finally, click `FINISH`

We'll be returned to the `Clusters` page, with the new cluster we've just created in the list, of status `PROVISIONING`.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/new-cluster-ui-5.png)

Clicking on our new cluster gives us the current provisioning status, in this case, my Master has been provisioned and my Worker VM is still provisioning.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/new-cluster-ui-6.png)

If you still have the VSphere UI open, you will be able to see the platform orchestrating the new VM's needed for this Kubernetes cluster.

Until the cluster is provisioned and healthy, shortcuts to access the cluster dashboard and access credentials are disabled:

Once both master and worker read `PROVISIONED`, we can download the token via the buttons in the screenshot above and also open the Kubernetes Dashboard.

# 5. Access Your Kubernetes Cluster, by UI.
If you click on your cluster within the Cisco Cloud Platform UI, you will see a number of buttons at the right hand side. Click on "Download Token", this will provide you a "Kubernetes Environment" file, which provides authentication to access your Kubernetes Cluster.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/1234user-cluster-build-success.png)

There is also a button to open the Kubernetes Dashboard UI for your cluster! Click that and see your freshly provisioned Kubernetes cluster!

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/kubernetes-dashboard-auth.png)

Wether accessing kubernetes via the dashboard UI, API or `kubectl` CLI, authentication is needed. Choose `Kubeconfig` (default) and select the authentication file you just downloaded.

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/select-k8s-token.png)

Then you will be given access to your clusters Dashboard!

![](/posts/files/CiscoContainerPlatform-101/assets/images/kubernetes-dashboard.png)

Congratulations, we've provisioned and accessed a brand new Kubernetes cluster in our Cisco Container Platform Environment!


Lets rip this cluster down before we continue!
Click "Delete" from within the cluster details screen to ensure we have enough resources in the sandbox for the API cluster!

# Next Steps!
Next, Create another cluster from the API and deploy some applications! Click the right arrow to continue!
