# Building a Docker Image

Next we'll build our own Ubuntu Docker image instead of using the one
from DockerHub.

1. Download the files  
Begin by downloading the Dockerfile and its dependencies.  
   ```
   git clone -b dist https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core.git
   ```

2. Check the Dockerfile  
Change directory to the cloned repository and ensure that the
Dockerfile is present.
   ```
   cd docker-brew-ubuntu-core/xenial
   ls .
   ```

3. Build a new image using Docker and the Dockerfile  
   ```
   docker build .
   ```  
Docker prints progress messages as it builds the Ubuntu image. Once it
finishes building the image, Docker assigns it a randomly-chosen name.  

4. Run the command `docker images`  
Docker lists all the images on your system, including both the
newly-built one and any that you previously downloaded. You can tell
which image is the one you just created by examining the list; it's
the only image that isn't associated with a repository:   
![Docker Images](assets/images/images1.png)

5. Run the new image
Run the newly created docker image by giving the randomly-chosen ID to
Docker:
   ```
   docker run -ti <your image ID>
   ```  
The newly-created image behaves exactly the same way as the Ubuntu
image from Dockerhub because was built from the same Dockerfile.


# Building the Custom Cisco Learning Labs Container

To modify the image that we just built all we have to do is change the
Dockerfile and ensure that any resources needed by the new Dockerfile
are available in the repository. Let's do that; let's make an image
that's more specific to our application's needs.

I'm currently sitting in at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017 in the wonderful
city of Berlin, so let's change the image to say that when it runs!

![Custom Docker Output](assets/images/hellocustom1.png)

To do this we will

* Create a new Python script.

* Tell our Dockerfile to include the script in our container build

* Also tell our Dockerfile to install python in the container
  (remember, dependancies all need to be there too!)

* Build and test our new container.

## You have a choice young Jedi.

You can either copy and paste, manually type the next set of commands
in OR download the following repo from github where i've written out
the files, just clone the repo below into your play-with-docker
terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/matjohn2/container-intro-devnet.git
cd container-intro-devnet
```

We now see two files:

Our 'app', a simple python file which prints our message.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

print("Hello from DevNET at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017!")
```

Then, a dockerfile that builds our app container.

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py
CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]
```

Our Dockerfile says

* `FROM ubuntu`, this EXTENDS the existing ubuntu public docker image,
  without having to re-build it ourselves each time. (remember the
  other images used `FROM scratch`, they were not building on any
  other images)

* `RUN apt-get update`, this make sure the package management tools
  within our base ubuntu container are ready.

* `RUN apt-get -y install python`, We use apt-get (which is why we
  wanted our container to be based off the ubuntu one) to install
  python and all it's dependancies into the container for us.

* `ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py`, We add our application python
  file from the local directory into our container build as
  `/hellodevnet.py`

* `CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]`, whenever we run our container, we want it
  to run our python app.

And thats all there is to it. Lets build our new app container!

```
docker build .
```

![Custom Docker
 Build](assets/images/dockerbuildcustom.png)

Run your new Container! You should see our app run and give you the
hello message.

## Congratulations, you've just built and run a custom docker image!

So far though, all our output has been on the command line. Apps that
output hello aren't that useful.

Lets continue and build something useful... Like a Webserver!
