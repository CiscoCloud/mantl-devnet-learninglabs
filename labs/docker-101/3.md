# Building a Docker Image

Next we'll build our own Ubuntu Docker image instead of using the one from DockerHub.

1. __Download the files__. Begin by downloading the Ubuntu Dockerfile and its dependencies.  
   ```
   git clone --single-branch https://github.com/tianon/docker-brew-ubuntu-core.git
   ```

2. __Check the Dockerfile__. Change directory to the cloned repository and ensure that the Dockerfile is present.  
   ```
   cd docker-brew-ubuntu-core/xenial
   ls .
   ```  
   
3. __Build a new image using Docker and the Dockerfile__.  
   ```
   docker build .
   ```  

Docker prints progress messages as it builds the Ubuntu image. Once it finishes building the image, Docker assigns it a randomly-chosen name.

4. __Run the command `docker images`__.  Docker lists all the images on your system, including both the newly-built one and any that you previously downloaded. You can tell which image is the one you just created by examining the list; it's the only image that isn't associated with a repository:  
      ![Docker Images](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/images1.png)

5. __Run the new image__. Run the newly created docker image by giving the randomly-chosen ID to Docker:
   ```
   docker run -ti <your image ID>
   ```  
   The newly-created image behaves exactly the same way as the Ubuntu image from Dockerhub because was built from the same Dockerfile. You now have a bash root prompt. Enter ``ls`` to confirm standard Ubuntu directories are installed.

# Building a Custom Cisco Learning Labs Container

To modify the image that we just built, all we have to do is change the Dockerfile and ensure that any needed resources are available in the repository. Let's make an image that's more specific to our application's needs.

I'm currently sitting in at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017 in the wonderful
city of Berlin, so let's change the image to say that when it runs:

![Custom Docker Output](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/hellocustom1.png)

To make the image display that message we will:

1. Create a new Python script.  

2. Edit the Dockerfile to include that script in the container build.  

3. Change the Dockerfile to install python in the container (remember,
all dependencies must be present in the container).  

4. Build and test the new container.  

You have a choice young Jedi:

You can either

* Copy and paste following Dockerfile commands
* Type them into the file manually
* Download the Github repository that contains them

To clone the Github repository that contains the Dockerfile for this
section using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/matjohn2/container-intro-devnet.git
cd container-intro-devnet
```

The cloned repository contains two files:

* hellodevnet.py
* Dockerfile

The "hellodevnet.py" file is our custom application. It contains the
following Python code:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python

print("Hello from DevNET at Cisco LIVE! Europe 2017!")
```

The Dockerfile contains the instructions needed to build the custom
image:

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py
CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]
```

This Dockerfile says:

1. `FROM ubuntu`  
   Extend the existing ubuntu public docker image. Our previous
   examples built an image from scratch. In this case we begin with a
   previously-built container image and extend with our own
   customizations.

2. `RUN apt-get update`  
   Ensure the package-management tools in the base Ubuntu container
   are updated to use the latest software.

3. `RUN apt-get -y install python`  
   Use apt-get to install Python and all its dependencies in the
   container. The reason to build this container on an existing Ubuntu
   image was so that we could use apt-get to install needed software.

4. `ADD hellodevnet.py /hellodevnet.py`  
   Copy our Python program from the local directory into the container
   as `/hellodevnet.py`.

5. `CMD ["/hellodevnet.py"]`  
   Run our Python program when the container starts up.

That's all there is to it! Now let's actually build the new container image.

```
docker build .
```

![Custom Docker Build](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/dockerbuildcustom.png)

After the Docker build completes you can run the new Container. When
you do, you should see the "hello" message displayed in the container
terminal.

Congratulations, you've just built and run a custom docker image!

Now let's build a container image that does something more useful: how
about a container that runs a web server?
