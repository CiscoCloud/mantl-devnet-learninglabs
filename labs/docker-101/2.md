# Creating a Docker image

How did the author of "hello-world" create the container image?
Because it's available on the public DockerHub repository, we can find
out by inspecting the files.

Browse to [the "hello world" web
page](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/) to see details describing
the Docker image.

Among those details is a link to the __Dockerfile__, the file that
defines the image.

## The Dockerfile

Every Docker image, from a simple one like "hello-world" to a complex
application, is defined by a __Dockerfile__. The Dockerfile is a text
file that describes programs and resources that become part of the
Docker image and that instruct Docker what to do when the container
runs. An author creates a Docker image by assembling application
source code and other resource files and writing a Dockerfile that
turns them into a working container image.

To create the container image, the author executes the
`docker build` command from the directory that contains the
Dockerfile. Docker reads the Dockerfile and follows the instructions
in it to build the container image. Once the Docker image is built,
the author pushes it to the public repository on DockerHub, making it
available to everyone.

Most container authors store their Dockerfiles in a version-control
repository along with the files used in building their images. Storing
a Dockerfile along with the files that it uses to build a container
simplifies both the Dockerfile itself and the process of building the
container image.

The "hello-world" repository illustrates this practice:

![hello-world codebase](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/hello-codebase.png)

All of the files used in this very simple container are stored in the
repository together with the Dockerfile.

# The "hello-world" Dockerfile

This is the hello-world Dockerfile:

```
FROM scratch
COPY hello /
CMD ["/hello"]
```

Here's what it tells `docker build` to do:

`FROM scratch`

"FROM scratch" means that the new Docker image starts with a fresh,
empty container. It's also possible to build an image based on one
that already exists. To do that, change "scratch" to the name of the
starting container.

`COPY hello /`

Copy the local file ‘hello’ into the root of the container image. The
reason for storing Dockerfiles together with related application files
is so that the Dockerfile can conveniently refer to those files and
direct Docker to add them to a container.

`CMD ["/hello"]`

Run the command "hello" when the container image starts. When someone
uses `docker run` to execute this container image, Docker
automatically runs the program identified in this line.

# Application Dependencies

When an application runs from a Docker container, it's completely
isolated from the system it's running on. That means that every
program and other resource that the application needs to run must be
included in the container image. The Dockerfile must ensure that
everything the application needs is included in the image or it won't
work correctly.

In the "hello-world" example the only resource that the image needs is
the compiled binary `hello`. The Dockerfile mentions no other
resources because none are needed for it to run.

What if you want to create a container that runs a more complicated
application? What if, for example, you want to build a container that
runs the NGINX webserver? NGINX requires a long list of supporting
files and libraries. A Dockerfile that builds an NGINX image must take
care to include all of those dependencies in the container or it'll
fail to work.

To determine the linked libraries needed by a compiled C program, use
the command `ldd`:

![NGINX dependencies](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/ldd1.png)

All the listed libraries must be present before NGINX can run.

If we were configuring a standalone host to run NGINX, or if we were
preparing a virtual machine, we would use operating-system package
managers such as apt or yum to install all of the libraries and other
resources that NGINX needs. That's not what we're doing,
though. Building a Docker container to run a complex application like
NGINX requires a different approach.

## OS Userspace Containers

A container image can be built with a complete Linux userspace inside
it. You can, for example, build a Docker container image that contains
all of the parts of the Ubuntu system needed to run NGINX.

On the one hand, building a whole userspace into a container means
that the container image may be quite large&mdash;perhaps hundreds of
megabytes.

On the other hand, it means that even a complex application with many
dependencies can be delivered in the form of a container image. The
container can even include operating-system package-management
software like apt or yum for use in configuring optional dependencies.

Suppose you want to build a container image that includes the whole
Ubuntu system. Begin by searching DockerHub for a suitable container
to start with:

```
docker search ubuntu
```

We're in luck; DockerHub has an existing Ubuntu container.

Run the container now:

```
docker run -ti ubuntu
```

The example command downloads and runs the Ubuntu container from
DockerHub. The command-line flags "-ti" tell Docker that we want to
interact with a shell in the running image. As soon as the image
finishes launching it dutifully presents us with a shell:

![Ubuntu shell](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/ubuntu1.png)

# Testing Isolation.

The processes that run in a Docker container are completely isolated
from the outside world. Files and processes on the host machine are
invisible to the application in the container. The container
application can't create or interact with any files or other resources
outside the container.

For example, suppose you use the shell in the container to create a
new file at the root of the filesystem:

```
touch /hello
ls /
```

The new file, "hello", appears in the root of the filesystem. Now
leave the container and examine the host filesystem:

```
#exit the container
exit

#run ls on the host
ls /
```

File `hello` isn't there. Why not? Because the host filesystem and the
container filesystem are completely separate. Creating the "hello"
file in the root of the container had no effect on the filesystem of
the host.

In this case, typing `exit` in the container kills the container and
its application. We can see which containers are running on the host
using this command:

`docker ps`

In this case no containers are running. We started only the
"hello-world" container, and our `exit` command stopped it.

If we run `docker run -ti ubuntu` again it creates a brand new
instance of the Ubuntu container. Because the container instance is
freshly created, the `/hello` file won't be there. That file is
something that we created by interacting with the container, not a
resource that was built into the container image. Because it's not
part of the image, it's not present when the container runs.

It's important to remember that changes to a running Docker container
dont survive after the container is killed. If you want to add a
resource to a Docker container and make it available in all future
sessions, then you must modify the Dockerfile to include the resource
and then rebuild the image.

# The Ubuntu Dockerfile

Let's look at the Dockerfile that built the Ubuntu image. You can find
the Ubuntu Dockerfile at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).

Click the link to the Dockerfile just as we did with the "hello-world"
image. The Ubuntu DockerFile is more complex, as we would expect, but
the concepts are exactly the same:

```
FROM scratch
ADD ubuntu-xenial-core-cloudimg-amd64-root.tar.gz /

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```

The commands in the Dockerfile copy the Ubuntu filesystem into the
container, including all needed tools and libraries, then makes
several changes to ensure that the contained version of Ubuntu works
as expected.

The final command in the Dockerfile,

`CMD["/bin/bash"]`

runs bash, ensuring that the container offers users a working shell
when it starts up.

Again, the Ubuntu Dockerfile is stored in a repository along with its
supporting files, notably including the .tar.gz archive that contains
the Ubuntu files.

In the next section we'll build our own Docker container.
