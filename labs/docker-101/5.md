# How to remove an existing Docker Container and Images

In this section, you will learn how to remove/delete old instances of Docker container and its images. Also, you can learn and practice additional Docker commands.

1. In the Windows PowerShell mode, run the following command to get the list of containers:
   
   `docker ps -a`
   
   ![](assets/images/Docker-new1.png)  
    
2. If you want to remove the old instances of the container, execute the following command:
   
   **Note**: Docker will not allow to remove the running container directly, hence you need to apply `docker stop`
    command to stop the process.   
    
    `docker rm $(docker ps -qa)`

3. To get the list of existing docker images, execute the following command:
   
   `docker images`
   
4. If you want to remove the docker image, execute the following command:
    **Note:** You can add the first three characters of the "IMAGE ID", so that the docker will automatically pick the right one!.
   
   `docker rmi <image id>`
