# Building A Webserver Container.

A Docker container image can run any application you like. Let's build
one that runs a Webserver that starts up when the container image
runs.

The following python command creates and starts a simple webserver:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

To build a container that runs this webserver we only need to change
the command that the container runs when it starts up.

The dockerfile looks like this:

```
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install python
EXPOSE 8000
ENTRYPOINT [“python”, “-m”, “SimpleHTTPServer”, “8000”]
```

The first three lines are familiar. The last two introduce new
Dockerfile options.

* EXPOSE 8000  
  The EXPOSE command tells Docker to make port 8000 available for
  incoming TCP/IP connections. If the Dockerfile doesn't expose a port
  for HTTP connections then no one will be able to connect to the
  webserver.

* ENTRYPOINT [“python”, “-m”, “SimpleHTTPServer”, “8000”]
  Like CMD, the ENTRYPOINT command runs a program, but it also enables
  us to pass arguments to the command that it runs. We use this
  feature to pass the arguments to Python that are needed to start the
  webserver.

Save the Dockerfile in a new directory and build the new webserver
container image:
```
docker build .
docker run <your new container id>
```

Why don't we see any output?

This is the first time we've used the `docker run` command and seen no
output from the container image when it started. The reason we see no
output is that our application, a webserver, doesn't print any. So how
do we know whether it's running correctly?

Run the following Docker command:

```
docker ps
```

The command lists all running containers&mdash;including the new
webserver image that we created:

![docker ps
 webserver](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/dockerpsweb.png)

How do we connect to the webserver process? By default Docker gives
each container an internal IP address on the host. We can find out our
container's IP address by running `docker inspect <container
ID>`. RUnning this command displays a great deal of information about
the container. Included in the output is the container's address,
identified as "IPAddress":

![Docker Inspect](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/dockerinspect.png)

Now we know the IP address and port on which the webserver can be
reached. Let's make a connection!

```
curl http://<container IP>:8000
```

By default the webserver serves the root directory of the
container:

![Success](/posts/files/docker-101/assets/images/success.png)

Success! We can see webserver running in the container that we
created, displaying a list of the files in the container's root
directory.

## Extra credit

You know how to `ADD` files to the Docket build process. If you create
a file named "index.html", add some HTML text to it, and add it to the
Dockerfile, guess what new webserver container will serve instead of
the directory listing?

Give it a try!


# Summary

In this learning lab we have:

* Understood how Docker images are built using Dockerfiles

* Understood how publicly-available Docker images are built by viewing
  their Dockerfiles

* Built and run our own Docker images

* Connected to a webserver running in a custom Docker container that
  we built

Give yourself a pat on the back, grab a coffee and enjoy the suggested
labs on the next page.

Thats all folks!
