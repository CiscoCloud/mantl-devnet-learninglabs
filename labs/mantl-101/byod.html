<p>If you are following this lab on your own device, then there are some pre-requisite tools you'll need installed...</p>
<p> git - Git is the source control tool used for the mantl.io project, it will be needed to copy the project to your local machine. <p>
<p> VirtualBox - Virtualbox is a free hypervisor tool for Mac, Windows and Linux, it allows you to run Virtual Machines on your machine. We use this to create your local Mantl environment. <p>
<p> Vagrant - Vagrant makes using local virtualization tools (like VirtualBox) easy, it takes our VM definitions from thr Mantl project and builds the virtual machine for you. <p>
