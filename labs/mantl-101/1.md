# Objective

In this Lab we will deploy a Mantl.io Container cluster onto your local machine.
This will provide a cloud-agnostic platform for running containerized or Docker applications.
From here, we will deploy a Sample application to the new cluster.

For more information about the what, why and how of Mantl, see our website at [Mantl.io](https://mantl.io).


# Prerequisites

You must have git, Vagrant and Virtualbox for your environment installed.
If you are at a Cisco learninglabs booth, this has been done for you.
The steps are also curated for the Windows-based learninglabs environment. Screenshots and location of tools will differ if following this guide at home on Linux or Mac.

# Check the environment is clean

As the learninglab environments are shared; Lets quickly make sure there are no old Mantl clusters running on the machine.

First, go to ``` Start > All Programs > cygwin > cygwin ``` to open a command prompt (as shown below).

Run the following command to remove any previous Mantl codebase downloaded.

``` rm -r mantl ```

Now, go to ``` Start > All Programs > Oracle VirtualBox > Virtualbox ``` to open up the VirtualBox VM Manager.
This should have no 'mantl' named Virtual Machines showing in the Left bar, if it does, right click them and choose "remove" from the menu. You can delete all files if prompted.

# Clone the Mantl repository

Now we have a clean environment, it's time to deploy our own Mantl cluster, first, clone the Mantl codebase using git. In the command prompt we opened earlier, type:

``` git clone https://github.com/ciscocloud/mantl ```

![Clone the Mantl Repository](/posts/files/mantl-101/assets/images/clone-mantl.png)

Once the download is complete, tell git to use the latest stable release of the codebase (otherwise we will end up deploying an untested development version) by typing the following command:

``` cd mantl ```
``` git checkout 1.0.2 ```

Your prompt should now show the following (colors may vary):

# Check the Configuration

Now we can configure our deployment. Type in the command ``` notepad.exe Vagrantfile ``` to open the configuration file (called 'Vagrantfile') in a text editor.
Ensure you set the line ``` "edge_count" => 0 ``` to ``` => 1 ``` and save the file. This allows us to bring up a full mantl cluster (instead of just the core components).

Once you have saved the configuration file ``` File > save ```, close notepad, otherwise you wont be able to type subsequent commands on the command prompt.

# Setup Security

Mantl is aimed at enterprise container deployments in the field, as such, we don't ship it with default passwords or security certificates as this leaves default installations open to hackers.

Instead, there is a security-setup script that creates all the necessary security items for you, per deployment.

Usually, we would run this python script to generate a 'security.yml' file like so: ``` python security-setup ```.
However, to keep all the demos consistent in this scenario, we can download an existing demo-security.yml file as follows:

``` curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CiscoCloud/mantl-devnet-learninglabs/master/labs/mantl-101/assets/security.yml > security.yml ```

# Deploy Mantl!

All thats left to do is use our automation (provided with the Mantl codebase) to deploy a working mantl cluster, we do this with a simple command:

``` vagrant up ```

At this point, you will see Vagrant downloading the needed images to boot VM's within VirtualBox, and then install the Mantl cluster.
This step will vary in time depending on your local internet download speeds.

If you receive the following error at this point, you have an older version of vagrant, please seek help from one of the DevNet staff within the learninglabs.
(if you are following these instructions at home, we require Vagrant > 1.8, available from https://vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

![Vagrant needs updating](/posts/files/mantl-101/assets/images/vagrant-version-error.png)

Once the required items have been downloaded, you will see VM's being created in the 'VirtualBox' application, once these VM's are booted, the Vagrant automation will install the cluster software.
