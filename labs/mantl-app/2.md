# Deploying a basic app

To deploy an app in Marathon, you need to send commands to the `/v2/apps` endpoint.  In this example, basic authorization is required, and embedded into the Postman collection.

Because you will be creating a new app, you will use the HTTP POST method.  To define our app, a very minimal JSON configuration needs to be sent:

```json
{
    "id": "{{app_name}}",
    "cmd": "python -m SimpleHTTPServer $PORT0",
    "cpus": 0.5,
    "mem": 50,
    "instances": 1,
    "ports": [0]
}
```

* `id`: defines the name of our app in Marathon
* `cmd`: is the command that we want Marathon to execute.  In this case a simple python web server that will display the files in the same directory as the command.  We also are using the variable $PORT0 environment variable.  This is built in to Marathon.
* `cpus`: the number of CPUs that you want to allocate to this application
* `mem`: the amount of RAM you want to allocate to this application
* `instances`: how many instances you want to run
* `ports`: the value of `0` enables Marathon to allocate a port on your behalf

__Before running the collection in postman, you should create a global environment variable called `app_name`.  Pick a random name so you can identify it later.__

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/5a9509901ade3e23ff63)

__You may get a message that the collection is already in Postman.  Create a copy.__

Now that you have Postman open, you should see a folder named "DevNet Mantl Sandbox: Basic" containing the various commands we will execute.

Click on the first one, "Basic app on Marathon".

See that it is set to send a POST to the URI: `https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon/v2/apps`

Now click on the "Body" tab under that URL, and you'll see the JSON we referenced above.

If you click on "Send", you should see a result that resembles:

```json
{
  "id": "/appy-app",
  "cmd": "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 34500",
  "args": null,
  "user": null,
  "env": {},
  "instances": 1,
  "cpus": 0.5,
  "mem": 50,
  "disk": 0,
  "executor": "",
  "constraints": [],
  "uris": [],
  "storeUrls": [],
  "ports": [
    0
  ],
 ... snip ...
}
```


# Inspecting your work

Navigate to https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon using the credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `1vtG@lw@y`

You should see your instance running.

To view the output of the application, head to `https://<app_name>.app.mantldevnetsandbox.com`, where `<app_name>` is the name you set in the Postman global environment variable.

# Dynamically scaling your app

Head back to Postman.  

With Mesos and Marathon, you can dynamically scale your application.  This is very easy to do by sending an HTTP PUT to the `/v2/apps` endpoint.

Click on the "Scale UP Basic app on Marathon" link in the "DevNet Mantl Sandbox: Basic" collection.

Notice that it is configured to send a PUT to `https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon/v2/apps`, and also notice the JSON body that will be sent:

```json
[{
    "instances": 5,
    "id": "{{app_name}}"
}]
```

The square brackets indicate an Array in JSON, which means you can reconfigure multiple apps at the same time, for example.  In this case, we're increasing the `instances` property to a value of `5`.

Click on the "Send" button. You should see a result like this:

```json
{
  "version": "2016-06-11T18:38:01.818Z",
  "deploymentId": "6ebf3ef6-ef5e-491e-8624-86afab24248f"
}
```

Head back to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that the Marathon is allocating the new resources for you.

# Scaling down

Ok, we really don't need multiple istances of this app, so move to the next item in our collection: "Scale DOWN Basic app on Marathon".

This is almost identical to our previous step, with the small change of the `instances` property to `1`.

```json
[{
    "instances": 1,
    "id": "{{app_name}}"
}]
```

The result should resemble this:

```json
{
  "version": "2016-06-11T18:38:17.656Z",
  "deploymentId": "8abeb42d-6e19-4500-828a-8321ae60b7fc"
}
```

Head back to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that you're app is back to 1 instance.

# Removing our app

Time to clean up.  

Select the final item in the Postman collection: "Delete Basic app on Marathon".

To delete your app, you will send a request to `https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon/v2/apps/{appId}`

Click Send, and you should see a result that resembles:

```json
{
  "version": "2016-06-11T18:44:00.170Z",
  "deploymentId": "c08d71e3-bb90-4140-9691-ff0f5e20d915"
}
```

Head back to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that your app has been deleted.
