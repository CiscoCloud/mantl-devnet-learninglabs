# Deploying the My Hero app

1. Start by cloning the repository for the application using the Git command-line interface:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_demo.git
Cloning into 'myhero_demo'...
remote: Counting objects: 225, done.
remote: Total 225 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 225
Receiving objects: 100% (225/225), 1.69 MiB | 534.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (142/142), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

2. Change directory into the newly cloned directory:

```shell
$ cd myhero_demo
```

3. Ensure that you're using the correct version of the respository:

```shell
$  git checkout 6bcd5ed
Note: checking out '6bcd5ed'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 6bcd5ed... Fixed deployment of direct mode app.
```

4. Prepare your local environment:

```shell
$ source myhero_setup
```
