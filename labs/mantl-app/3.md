# Deploying a Docker container

Import a new collection, "DevNet Mantl Sandbox Docker," by clicking on the button below.

__If you skipped the last step...Before running the collection in postman, you should create a global environment variable called `app_name`.  Pick a random name so you can identify it later.__

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/c092b5e86a8a258b55a7)

__You may get a message that the collection is already in Postman.  Create a copy.__

After you've imported the new collection, click on the first example "Deploy nginx from Docker Hub".

In this scenario, a preconfigured Docker container hosted on Docker Hub will be loaded into Marathon.  

The following JSON will be sent using the HTTP POST to the same endpoint as our last example `/v2/apps`.

```json
{
    "container": {
        "type": "DOCKER",
        "docker": {
            "image": "ciscodevnet/mantl-demo",
            "forcePullImage": true,
            "network": "BRIDGE",
            "portMappings": [{
                "containerPort": 80,
                "hostPort": 0
            }]
        },
        "forcePullImage": true
    },
    "cpus": 1,
    "mem": 128,
    "instances": 1,
    "id": "{{app_name}}"
}
```

You should notice that rather than the `cmd` property, a new property called `container` takes its place.  Some of the less obvious properties and values are described below:

* `type`: Marathon has native support for Docker, but also supports LXC. Because ours is a Docker container, we use the value `DOCKER`.
* `image`: The image we are pulling the Docker container from: https://hub.docker.com/r/ciscodevnet/mantl-demo/
* `portMappings/containerPort`: This is the port that is open on the container.
* `portMappings/hostPort`: The value `0` enables Marathon and Mesos to dynamically allocate a port.

# Create the container on Marathon

In Postman, click on the "Send" button.  

You should see a result like this:

```json
{
  "id": "/appy-app",
  "cmd": null,
  "args": null,
  "user": null,
  "env": {},
  "instances": 1,
  "cpus": 1,
  "mem": 128,
  "disk": 0,
  "executor": "",
  "constraints": [],
  "uris": [],
  "storeUrls": [],
  "ports": [
    0
  ],
  "requirePorts": false,
  "backoffSeconds": 1,
  "backoffFactor": 1.15,
  "maxLaunchDelaySeconds": 3600,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "volumes": [],
    "docker": {
      "image": "ciscodevnet/mantl-demo",
      "network": "BRIDGE",
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 80,
          "hostPort": 0,
          "servicePort": 0,
          "protocol": "tcp"
        }
      ],
      "privileged": false,
      "parameters": [],
      "forcePullImage": true
    }
  },
... snip ...
}
```

Head to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that the Marathon is starting to run the container.  Since it is downloading the container from Docker Hub, it may take a couple of minutes to finish deploying.  

# Inspect the result

To view the output of the application, head to `http://<app_name>.app.mantldevnetsandbox.com`, where `<app_name>` is the name you set in the Postman global environment variable.

Load that page in your web browser, and see that it's operational.  The page should say "w00t! it works!".

# Scaling the container up

Just like we did in the previous step, you can use the same technique to scale up the container to `5` instances and scale it back down to `1` instance.

Open Postman, and click on the "Scale UP Docker app on Marathon".  Note that the JSON to be sent is exactly the same as the previous step.

Navigate to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that the Marathon is scaling the container. 

Head to `http://<app_name>.app.mantldevnetsandbox.com` and see that the app is still there!

# Scaling the container down 
After scaling the container up, you can now scale it down.

Open Postman, and click on the "Scale DOWN Docker app on Marathon".  Note that the JSON to be sent is exactly the same as the previous step.

Head to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that the Marathon is scaling the container down. 

Navigate to `http://<app_name>.app.mantldevnetsandbox.com` and see that the app is still there!

# Cleanup

In Postman, select the final item in the Postman collection: "Delete Docker app on Marathon".

Head back to the Marathon UI (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/marathon) and you'll see that your app has been deleted.
