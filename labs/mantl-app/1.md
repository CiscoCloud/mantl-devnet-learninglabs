# Mantl: Deploying a microservices application

# Objective

This learning lab will help you understand the general concepts of deploying a containerized, microservices application into Mantl.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# Audience

* Application developers
* DevOps engineers

# Prerequisites

* Git client
* Access to the Cisco DevNet Mantl Sandbox (https://mantlsandbox.cisco.com/ui)

# What is Mantl?

Mantl is a package of popular Cloud Native systems, such as Mesos and Marathon for container scheduling and management.  Rather than spending weeks getting your infrastructure up-and-running, you can use the Mantl installer to install and configure a Mantl cluster.  

# What is a containerized app?

A container is essentially a way to package your entire application stack into a self-contained unit.  While containers have existed for a while, Docker has made it easy and popularized the concept.  When using Docker, you will find that your containers are essentially versioned.

An example of the `docker images` command that shows you two repositories and which tag (or version) has been made available on Docker Hub.  Docker Hub is a way to share containers over the internet.

```
REPOSITORY                            TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
node                                  5.11.1              6300cb2bfbd4        2 weeks ago         647.6 MB
alpine                                latest              14e13b07dc83        4 weeks ago         4.797 MB

# What is a microservices architecture?

A microservices architecture is an application that is broken down into its components.  For example, you may have several API services that make up a blog service.  You might have a User API, Content API, and a UI service.  Rather than building your application in a single container/binary/package, you would break these APIs and the UI service into multiple containers.

# The My Hero app

In this learning lab, you will be using an example application that has been designed using microservices patterns.  

The application provides a simple interface for gathering and reporting votes about the best movie superheros.

The application is built in a microservice style wrapping each service in a docker container that can be deployed and run in Mantl. In its initial form the application has three services.

* [myhero/data](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_data) - This service stores all the data about candidates and votes cast.
* [myhero/app](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_app) - This service provides the basic logic layer for accessing and recording votes.
* [myhero/web](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_web) - This is the main user interface for casting votes.
