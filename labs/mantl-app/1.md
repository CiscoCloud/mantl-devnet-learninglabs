# Mantl: Deploying applications into Marathon

# Objective

In this Learning Lab, you will learn how to deploy applications in Marathon, which is running inside of Mesos (as a Mesos framework).  First we will create a very basic web server.  Next, we will pull down a Docker container and deploy it on Marathon.  In each case, we will be using the Marathon REST API to manage the application lifecycles.

# What is Mantl?

Mantl is a package of popular Cloud Native systems, such as Mesos for cluster management, Marathon for container management, and Traefik as a reverse proxy.  Rather than spending weeks getting your infrastructure up-and-running, you can use the Mantl installer to install and configure a Cloud Native cluster.  

# What is a containerized app?

A container is essentially a way to package your entire application stack into a self-contained unit.  While containers have existed for a while, Docker has made it easy and popularized the concept.  When using Docker, you will find that your containers are essentially versioned.
