# Mantl: Deploying applications into Marathon

# Objective

In this Learning Lab, you will learn how to deploy applications in Marathon, which is running inside of Mesos (as a Mesos framework).  First we will create a very basic web server.  Next, we will pull down a Docker container and deploy it on Marathon.  In each case, we will be using the Marathon REST API to manage the application lifecycles.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# What is Mantl?

Mantl is a package of popular Cloud Native systems, such as Mesos for cluster management, Marathon for container management, and Traefik as a reverse proxy.  Rather than spending weeks getting your infrastructure up-and-running, you can use the Mantl installer to install and configure a Cloud Native cluster.  This Learning Lab will walk you through steps using a Mantl cluster running in the Cisco DevNet Sandbox.

# What is a containerized app?

A container is essentially a way to package your entire application stack into a self-contained unit.  While containers have existed for a while, Docker has made it easy and popularized the concept.  When using Docker, you will find that your containers are essentially versioned.  The Marathon package that is installed by Mantl is designed to run containers in a standard "container stack".

# Outline of scenarios

In this tutorial, you will follow similar actions for each scenario.  This diagram should help you visualize how the pieces in the Mantl stack interact.  The left side of the diagram is intended to help you visualize the steps you will take and the interaction with Mantl components.  Observe that there are three main steps represented by the HTTP protocol snippets (e.g., `POST /v2/apps`) and arrows pointing into and out of the Mantl cluster.  The first thing you will do is to use Postman to create and deploy the app in Marathon.  After that you will use your web browser to see the results of the app you just created, and the cluster will return the web page you requested.

On the right-hand side, observe how the traffic flows through the system and where your app actually runs in the cluster.  Although not called out on the diagram, your app is actually orchestrated by Marathon and Mesos and runs on a "worker" role server.  Marathon uses the underlying Mesos cluster manager to allocate the resources for your app.  The edge nodes use a reverse-proxy, Traefik, to provide a single URL to access your application.

The lines are color coded to indicate the path of the request when we create the app as compared to when we are viewing the running app.  
* The blue lines shows the creation path using the control nodes.  This is where Marathon, and therefore the Marathon API, is running.  The control nodes "install" your app onto a worker.
* The green lines show the "end user" path, and the edge node directs traffic directly to your app.
